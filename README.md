# CLASS-PROJECTS
Here have added projects that i worked on during my class work
## Insurance Premium Estimator 
Here is the {Datased}(https://washiemorey.shinyapps.io/insurance/) Used
Here I created multiple Linear Regression model used to Estimate the amount of Premium to charge a client based on Traffic Violations Commited,Number of Driving Experience and also Gender.
This is very powerful model in insurance sector that could help save time used to set up Premiums by over 90%.
After building the model I created an input system that could be used by anyone to estimate Premium to Charge by inputing : Gender,Driving Experience and Violations Commited.
